            <h1>Security Mechanisms</h1>
            <p>Security mechanisms are very important when it comes to the internet and the modern technological world as a whole. People will try and take your information if it is useful to them or to try and sabotage your business. To combat these attacks, security mechanisms are used to ensure that your data is safe. It is essential to protect your network and systems from data breaches as it usually contains valuable personal information that should not be shared with strangers online especially as the people trying to get your data usually have malicious intentions.</p>
<br>
<p>Businesses and the public use security mechanisms as no one wants their data to be accessed by unauthorized people, so when they need protection, they use security mechanisms. They make it harder to access this data by adding layers of protection in order to keep the data safe. Currently, cyber-attacks are getting increasingly more common. According to aag-it.com [1], nearly 1 billion emails were exposed in 2022, 39% of UK businesses reported suffering a cyber-attack in 2022 and Cybercrime cost UK businesses an average of £4200 in 2022. Because of the rise in cyber-attacks, we need to also increase the use of security mechanisms to ensure that we are safe at all times from these attacks. Not using security mechanisms creates a huge security risk in our life which could cause a lot of damage and cost a lot of money. Most people store a lot of information on their devices so if these devices get breached, they could lose passwords, personal information and even money through online banking.</p>
<br>
<p>Everyone uses security mechanisms in some way whether you use a simple one such as a password, or a more complex, more effective security mechanism such as a firewall. antivirus software, encryptions, two-factor authentication and others are examples of security mechanisms. This is what they are, and what they do to help protect your data: </p>
<br>
            <h2>Passwords</h2>
            <p>Passwords are the most common security mechanism used to protect information systems, emails, social media accounts, devices and many more. When creating a password, make sure it is strong and difficult to guess. Use letters, numbers, and symbols to make sure the password is unique as possible, making it harder to guess. Don’t use common passwords such as ‘Password123’ as they are the easiest passwords to guess, also do not use your name in your password as again this will be easy to guess. It is very important to never share your password with anyone and avoid using the same password for multiple accounts.</p>
<br>
            <h3>Antivirus Software</h3>
            <p>Antivirus software is a tool that helps to protect your computer from viruses and other types of malware. It scans your computer and detects any viruses that may have been placed onto your computer from links, online downloads, infected email attachments, or by plugging in infected devices like a USB stick. According to dataprot.net [2], 46% of hackers disseminating malware deliver it almost exclusively through email. This means that you get sent an email which usually contains information such as you have won a prize or give you deals to a website, and it tells you to follow the link to claim but when you press the link your computer downloads the virus which is then going to attack your computer. You can get anti-virus for free online, or you can pay for it if you choose to. </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Firewalls </h4>
            <p>A firewall acts as a barrier between your computer and the internet, it is made to block any unwanted traffic and make sure no viruses get through to your computer. You create rules that the firewall will block for example at schools they usually use firewalls to block social media so students are not on social media in school. Firewalls also stop any unwanted malware from getting to the data that they are protecting. </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Encryption </h5>
            <p>Encryption is the process of converting your information into code. This makes it difficult for others to read and understand, therefore hiding your passwords. This is very important when you send sensitive information over the internet, such as passwords, credit card details and data. If you want an example of encryption, look for the padlock icon in your browser's address bar at the top left of your screen. This padlock shows that the website prevents interception of data going from your browser to the website's server. </p>
            <br>
            <h6>Two Factor </h6>
            <p>Two-factor authentication, also known as 2FA, is a security mechanism that adds an extra layer of security to accounts that you own. 2FA asks you to provide your phone number so that it can send you a text message containing a code to be able to access your account. It also sends you a text whenever there is a login attempt on your account so that you can verify that you are trying to log in and not anyone else. A lot of social media accounts use 2FA to ensure that you are the person you say you are. </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <P>These security mechanisms are used to help protect users' information systems from anyone with unauthored access. It is very important to be careful when using technology and ensure that your data doesn’t get leaked.  </p>
