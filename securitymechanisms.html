            <h1>Security Mechanisms</h1>
            <p>Security mechanisms are very important when it comes to the internet and the modern technological world as a whole. People will try and take your information if it is useful to them or to try and sabotage your business. To combat these attacks, security mechanisms are used to ensure that your data is safe. It is essential to protect your network and systems from data breaches as it usually contains valuable personal information that should not be shared with strangers online especially as the people trying to get your data usually have malicious intentions.</p>
<br>
<p>Businesses and the public use security mechanisms as no one wants their data to be accessed by unauthorized people, so when they need protection, they use security mechanisms. They make it harder to access this data by adding layers of protection in order to keep the data safe. Currently, cyber-attacks are getting increasingly more common. According to aag-it.com [1], nearly 1 billion emails were exposed in 2022, 39% of UK businesses reported suffering a cyber-attack in 2022 and Cybercrime cost UK businesses an average of Â£4200 in 2022. Because of the rise in cyber-attacks, we need to also increase the use of security mechanisms to ensure that we are safe at all times from these attacks. Not using security mechanisms creates a huge security risk in our life which could cause a lot of damage and cost a lot of money. Most people store a lot of information on their devices so if these devices get breached, they could lose passwords, personal information and even money through online banking.</p>
<br>
<p>Everyone uses security mechanisms in some way whether you use a simple one such as a password, or a more complex, more effective security mechanism such as a firewall. antivirus software, encryptions, two-factor authentication and others are examples of security mechanisms. This is what they are, and what they do to help protect your data: </p>
