            <h1>Intro</h1>
            <p>With the rapid advancement in technology, cybersecurity threats are becoming increasingly complex and frequent. As of consequence, it is essential that mitigating threats are adamantly pursued by any user or entity surfing the internet to ensure sensitive information are not disclosed to unauthorised users. There are many practices that can be continually implemented to achieve this, including cyber incident exercising, regulating access control, firewalls, encryption, two-factor authentication, intrustion detection systems, and more.</p>
			
			
			<h1>Cyber incident exercising</h1>
				<p>Cyber incident exercising helps organisations to establish how resilient they are to cyber attack, and practice their response in a safe environment. </p>
				
			<h1>Access Control</h1>
				<p>Access controls are a method of ensuring that only authorised users (or automated systems) can access data or services. Through authentication and authorization, access control policies are put in place to make sure users are who they say they are and that they have the appropaite access to company data. </p>
