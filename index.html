				<h2>Week 1: Getting set up</h2>
				<p>Published on <time datetime="2022-10-05"><strong>October 05, 2022</strong></time> </p>
			</header>
				<p>In week 1 I finished the first Introduction to Web Development tutorial and finished with 3 basic webpages linked together (Index, Tutorial, Contact). I learnt to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Navigate and set up folders on my Brighton Domains workspace.</li>
					<li>Link 3 webpages together using anchors.</li>
					<li>Become familiar and use basic HTML tags such as <code>headers, anchors, paragraphs</code> and <code>unordered and ordered lists.</code></li>

				<h2>Week 2: Lists</h2>
				<p>Published on <time datetime="2022-10-12"><strong>October 12, 2022</strong></time></p>
				</header>
				<p>In week 2 I finished lab tutorial week 2, in which I learnt to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Add publication date to posts.</li>
					<li>Put a list in a post, such as this one.</li>
					<li>Create navigation within the page using anchors (E.g. "Go to top").</li>
					<li>Use the img tag to add an image.</li>
					<li>Provide a link to my Email address at the footer of the webpage which will automatically open the default Email application, if installed, with my Email address already put in as the receiver.</li>
					<li>Validate my HTML via the <a href = "https://validator.w3.org/">W3C website</a> so that when we eventually implement CSS no errors occur. Validating my website also provided clarity on why some things we not working on my website as intended. </li>

				<h2>Week 3: More lists, tables</h2>
				<p>Published on <time datetime="2022-10-19"><strong>October 19, 2022</strong></time></p>
				</header>
				<p>In week 3 I finished lab tutorial week 3, in which I learnt to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Use more list tags (<code>ul</code>,<code> dd</code>,<code> dl</code> and <code>dt</code>).</li>
					<li>Add a table in HTML, although formatting the table with a border was only appropiate when learning CSS. As an example I made my current University of Brighton timetable.</li>
					<li>Quote texts, using them to provide citations for the source.</li>
					<li>Make an image into a link.</li>
				</ol>
				<p class ="dropcap">In prepartion for studying Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) next week, I took time at home to understand the fundamentals by practicing at <a href= "https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">CW3 Schools webpage for CSS.</a> This prompted me to prepare my website to be attached with an external stylesheet. To do this I copied the provided basic style sheets "stylesheet.css" and "normalize.css" files into the previously made "css" folder on new text files, and I also added tag lines on all my HTML webpages just after the <code>title</code> and <code>meta</code> tags to link and to refer to the stylesheets, as evident with the screenshots below. I also took the initiative to begin using FileZilla, a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) application, as a means of updating my website - as previously uploading to brighton domains was time-consuming and inconvenient when done repetitively.</p>

					<h2>Week 4: Introduction to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>
					<p>Published on <time datetime="2022-10-26"><strong>October 26, 2022</strong></time></p>
					</header>
					<p>In week 4 I finished lab tutorial week 4, in which I learnt to:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Become familiar with CSS Syntax.</li>
						<li>Style the body, table, headings, paragraph elements.</li>
						<li>Style a table.</li>
						<li>Use class selectors to style specific tag elements rather than style every single tag on on the webpage.</li>
						<li>Change style of text in a link when the link is visited, hoverd or active.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p class ="dropcap">Here is my webpage before and after it was styled with CSS. As I'm experimenting - the styling, including the colour, is subject to change. I noticed after formatting my webpage with CSS that my "first image" would not fit and needed to be resized to fit within the wrapper. So I opted to make it responsive and have the image to scale both up and down when needed. I also formatted the timetable as close as possible to my calender on My Brighton.</p>

						<h2>Week 5: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) II</h2>
						<p>Published on <time datetime="2022-11-02"><strong>November 02, 2022</strong></time></p>
						</header>
						<p>In week 5 I finished lab tutorial week 5, in which I learnt to:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Become more familiar with CSS, more specifically styling text. For example, drop caps.</li>
							<li>Understand the importance of specifying the font-family with a fallback, so that the webpage will display another font in the absence of the original and intended one.</li>
							<li>Use web fonts, such as Google Fonts.</li>
							<li>Style paragraphs such as their: line-height, margin, text-indent, dropcap, text align.</li>
							<li>Float an image and wrap text around it.</li>
						</ol>
						<p class = "dropcap">One key point of Week 5 was to understand the CSS box model, which refers to the space taken by HTML elements. For my independent studies, in order to gain a better understanding of the box model I read <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model">MDNs Introduction to the CSS box model</a> which offered more insight into the four individual parts of the box model such as the Content area, Padding area, Border area and Margin area. Each with their respective edges and values. I also learnt about the relative and obsolute length units, including Pixels (px(picture x element)), percentage (%), rem, em, vw and vh. For now, I will primarily be using percentage as it will be useful when I proceed onto making my webpage responsive. Furthermore, after further research I discovered the use of the "parallax" effect that can be used in Web and Game Development, this effect gives off the illusion of making something seem further away by having it move slower in relation to the main body as the user navigates throughout the webpage. This is something I plan on implementing in the near future. For more information regarding the background on web pages I also read <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Backgrounds_and_Borders#properties">MDNs CSS Backgrounds and Borders.</a></p>
						
						<p>I took notice that my previous style was not exactly eye-candy, for example the <a href ="#contrast">contrast between the blue text and the background</a> made it a somewhat nuisance to read, so I have resorted to a more formal colour-palette. Also, before I understood how to float an image and to have text wrap around it, the W3S image just "sat" underneath the text. Here is a before and after image after floating the W3S image.</p>

							<h2>Week 6: Responsive Web Development (RWD)</h2>
							<p>Published on <time datetime="2022-11-09"><strong>November 09, 2022</strong></time></p>
							</header>
							<p class = "dropcap">In week 6 I started making my webpage responsive, meaning the webpage is tailored to the size, orientation and dimensions of any device. I first sketeched various wireframes of different layouts devices and taking their screen sizes into account(see below). I then set up the responsive grid by using <code>grid-area</code> for each appropiate HTML elements (e.g. webpagetitle,menu, nav, table, main, aside, footer and added media queries to set up 1 column (mobile devices), 2 column (tablet) and 3 (widescreen) layouts. After this I styled each screen width, for example the timetable will not show up on devices with a width smaller than 35em. In short, this week I learnt to: </p>
							<ol>
								<li>Sketch wireframes of different screen dimensions.</li>
								<li>Set up the responive grid.</li>
								<li>Style the webpage for different screen sizes.</li>
								<li>Hide elements, for example the timetable.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>This week I created an original tutorial for "Establishing Effective Study Habits" for the linked tutorial webpage. For my independent studies I discovered the use of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes">keyframes</a>. With this, I was able to animate the background colour of the banner as it goes through different colours and have it loop. I also used keyframes to move a procedural texture I made in Blender in the background as an image. To better understand media queiries and making webpages responsive I read <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries">MDNs Media Queries.</a></p>

								</header>
								<p class = "dropcap">In week 7 I continued making making my webpage responsive. This week I learnt to: </p>
								<ol>
									<li>Make images flexible with text wrapping.</li>
									<li>Clip full-size images.</li>
									<li>Embed videos from Youtube and Vimeo onto the webpage, in this example record a clip of my webpage with the animated banner image.</li>
									
								</ol>
								<p>I also opted to do the extra work, in which I was able to implement the parallax effect which I mentioned in week 5 as-well as learning to repeat background images, and I also created a favicon - the small image that is displayed in the browser address bar or tab, next to the page title. As an avid 3D artist I am adamant on only using my own images/videos, as often as I can, so as to not risk any copyright infringement.</p>

								<p class = "dropcap">This week I heavily focused on formatting my webpage, whilst also making sure it is responsive. As I was formatting I decided to look for different references with websites akin to my own styling, and the one that piqued my intrest was the <a href="https://news.sky.com/uk">Sky News website.</a> Here is a before and after image of formatting.</p>

								<p class = "dropcap">Having finished most of my website, I opted to fine-tune the Contact webpage by tinkering with different styles. I decided to chose an approach similiar to the one I used for the Tutorial. Here is a before and after image of the Contact webpage.</p>

								<p class = "dropcap">For the final week before submission I made sure all three of my webpages (Learning Journal, Tutorial, and Contact) were all responsive and presented in a clear and appropriate format. I also ensured all 3 webpages were validated using <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">CW3 validator</a>, which after checking resulted in a plethora of errors that needed fixing. After validating I took screenshot evidence of all 3 webpages that they are free of errors which will be put in the submission folder.</p>
