            <h1>Intro (conception of privacy)</h1>
            <p>
         People respect their right to privacy and the security of their private lives. They value having some say in who can learn what about them. They most definitely do not want anyone to ever have access to their personal details. However, new developments in information technology put privacy at risk, reduced the amount of control over personal data, and made it more likely that access to personal data could have a variety of unfavourable effects. As the amount of processing of personal data increased in the second half of the 20th century, data protection laws were implemented.   (Van den Hoven, J. et a, 2019) 
         The value of privacy
         Concerns about adverse impacts are valid, as evidenced by the disclosures of Edward Snowden and, more recently, the Cambridge Analytica case (Cadwalladr & Graham-Harrison 2018). Government agencies and business actors use these technical skills on a regular basis to gather, store, and explore vast amounts of data related to phone calls, internet queries, and electronic payments. Many people's concerns have only grown as a result of China's ascent and the widespread use of cutting-edge digital technologies for monitoring and control. Personal information about current and prospective clients is now a valuable resource for businesses.  (Van den Hoven, J. et a, 2019)
         The debate over privacy is closely intertwined with the use of technology. The paper that started the discussion about privacy in the Western world argued that people have a right to privacy, based on the principle of "inviolate personality." Since then, the debate about privacy has been fuelled by claims about individuals' rights to control the extent to which others have access to them and claims about society's right to know about individuals. The development of information technology has been a major factor in the evolution of the privacy debate, and it is difficult to conceive of these concepts as separate from one another.

            <h1>Morals</h1>
         <p>According to Van den Hoven, J. et a, (2019) there are several different categories of moral justifications for protecting personal data and giving individuals direct or indirect authority over how others may obtain that data:
         Prevention of harm: A variety of methods can be used to damage the data subject if others have unrestricted access to their bank account, biography, social media account, cloud repository, characteristics, and whereabouts.
         Informational inequality: The use of data is becoming more and more like trading commodities, where individuals don't have the power to negotiate contracts or to check if partners are following the terms of the contract. Data protection laws, regulation and governance aim to establish fair conditions for transmitting and exchanging personal data, and to give data subjects checks and balances, guarantees of redress, and means to monitor compliance. These technologies, which exploit a basic informational inequality of principal and agent, are causing great disparities in access to information, choice modelling in marketing, micro-targeting in political campaigns, and nudging in policy implementation.
          Informational injustice and discrimination: Using personal information in one context (for example, in health care) may lead to different meanings and consequences in another context (for example, in commercial transactions). This can lead to discrimination and disadvantages for the individual.
         Encroachment on moral autonomy and human dignity: People who lack privacy are constantly exposed to outside factors that could affect their decisions, as they are aware that others are watching them. This can have a chilling effect on their autonomy and may lead to choices that someone without privacy would not have made.
         These laws are designed to protect the privacy of people who are being processed by organizations. The principle behind these laws is that people must be informed about what is happening to their personal data, and they have the right to control how it is used. In addition, the data must be used for a specific purpose, and the person who is processing the data must be accountable to some kind of oversight authority. However, it is impossible to always comply with these rules, so companies often use "privacy-enhancing technologies" to try to protect people's privacy.
